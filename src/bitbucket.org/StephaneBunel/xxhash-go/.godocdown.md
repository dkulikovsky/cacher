# xxhash-go

xxhash-go is a go (golang) wrapper for C [xxhash](http://code.google.com/p/xxhash/) - an extremely fast Hash algorithm,
working at speeds close to RAM limits.

xxhash-go provides package (xxhash) for go developers and one command line utility: xxh32sum.

## Install

Assuming that [go1](http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list) and [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download) are installed.

    go get bitbucket.org/StephaneBunel/xxhash-go
    go install bitbucket.org/StephaneBunel/xxhash-go/xxh32sum

## Benchmark

xxHash_test.go includes a quick and dirty benchmark.

```go test bitbucket.org/StephaneBunel/xxhash-go -bench=".*"```

Core i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz, x86_64 GNU/Linux 3.5.0:

```
Benchmark_xxhash32           50000000       43.2 ns/op (C binding)
Benchmark_goxxhash32         50000000       66.4 ns/op (Pure Go)
Benchmark_CRC32IEEE          10000000      149.0 ns/op
Benchmark_Adler32            20000000       90.2 ns/op
Benchmark_Fnv32              10000000      154.0 ns/op
Benchmark_MurmurHash3Hash32    500000     3080.0 ns/op
```

xxhash32 is more than two time faster than it's best competitor !

## xxh32sum

Usage: (Assuming that $GOPATH/bin is in your $PATH)

    % xxh32sum -h
    Usage: xxh32sum [<OPTIONS>] <filename> [<filename>] [...]
    OPTIONS:
      -readsize=1048576: Read buffer size
      -version=false: Show version

Checksum a file

    % xxh32sum /etc/passwd
    d2582536    /etc/passwd

Checksum from stdin

    % cat /etc/passwd | xxh32sum -
    d2582536

## xxHash package

### Examples

```
import xxh "bitbucket.org/StephaneBunel/xxhash-go"

h32 := xxh.Checksum32([]byte("Lorem ipsum..."))
```
